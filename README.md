## What's left:

Implement all the async functions

Right now all the functions have their own call all the async calls needs to be called with the "&" at the end

The kill signal has been implemented to use any signal possible create a simple kill then change the main kill into sigsend

Check the IOCTL if they work properly

## Might be good to do

Replace all the kernel allocation with slabs
